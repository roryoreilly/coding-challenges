    "# Gas Station\n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "Given two integer arrays A and B of size N.\n",
    "There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is A[i].\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs B[i] of gas to travel from station i\n",
    "to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, â€¦ n-1, 0, 1, 2.. Completing the circuit means starting at i and\n",
    "ending up at i again.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Input 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A =  [1, 2]\n",
    "    B =  [2, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Output 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    \n",
    "Explanation 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you start from index 0, you can fill in A[0] = 1 amount of gas. Now your tank has 1 unit of gas. But you need B[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If you start from index 1, you can fill in A[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your tank has 2 units of gas. You need B[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So, you travel to station 0 and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in A[0] = 1 unit of additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you B[0] = 2 to get to station 1, which you do and complete the circuit. "
